[Visualizing Gender Representation in Comic Books](https://benojeyacomicvine.github.io/)

#### Project for the class CS 7450 Fall 2020 at Georgia Institute of Technology with Prof. Alex Endert. 

Comic books are generally written by men, for men and are about men. With few female leads in superhero comics, women are used as token characters, and when portrayed are over-sexualized and stereotyped. Characters of color, LGBTQ make even fewer appearances. In this age, when comic books and superhero movies are billion-dollar commodities, we aim to study Gender Representation in Comic books. We hope to better understand gender representation and spark meaningful discussions about the importance of accurate representation. For this, we’re analyzing ComicVine (https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/) Database which contains over 40k+ characters. 

##### Some questions we’d like to answer
1. Gender Ratio over the years
1. Gender ratio in new characters introduced 
1. Gender imbalance in superpowers (physical abilities, gadgets)
1. Gendered names - (eg, is the moniker girl used more often than boy? Princess over prince)
1. Allegiance - how many villains are men/women?
